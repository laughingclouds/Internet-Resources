# LICENSE (FOR DUMMIES)

Hi dummy! This [LICENSE](https://github.com/r3a10god/Internet-Resources/blob/main/LICENSE) is meant for only the _links_ in this readme and not the projects themselves (i.e., forking this repo and changing the links into something else...I dunno why anyone would do that though). Please go through the licenses within _these_ projects or resources; if there are any, before trying anything funny with these projects.

### Why do dis?

Well, imagine my (or your) _Repositories_ tab being filled with forks. Imagine one having more forks (which they don't even contribute to) than their own repos.
