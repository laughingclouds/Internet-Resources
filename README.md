# LICENSE (FOR DUMMIES)

Hi dummy! This [LICENSE](https://github.com/r3a10god/Internet-Resources/blob/main/LICENSE) is meant for only the _links_ in this readme and not the projects themselves (i.e., you can fork this repo and change the links to something else(like...to a dead link...I dunno why anyone would do that though)). Please go through the licenses within _these_ projects or resources; if there are any, before trying anything funny with these projects.

### Why do dis?

Well, imagine my (or your) _Repositories_ tab being filled with forks. Imagine one having more forks (which they don't even contribute to) than their own repos.
